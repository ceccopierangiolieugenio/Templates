# Build and Run with docker-compose
### Prerequisites
* Install [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
### Build and Run
1. build and run the package
   ```shell
   make build
   make run
   ```
1. open: http://localhost:8080
# Test
[golang Unit Testing](https://golangdocs.com/golang-unit-testing), [Postman/Newman](https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman) and [Robot](https://hub.docker.com/r/ppodgorsek/robot-framework/) are used to test this project.
Docker compose is used to automate the tests;
* [Unit tests](test/docker-compose.test.server.yml) are executed in the building image
* (API) [Newman tests](test/docker-compose.postman.test.yml) is executed in the same network:
* (UI) [Robot tests](test/docker-compose.robotframework.test.yml) use the same setup as the *Newman Test*.
